# Strimzi Operator - Maintenance

This document describes how to maintain the Strimzi Operator.

Search for the latest version of the Kafka Operator here : [Strimzi Releases](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases)

Get the manifests for the selected version, for example the version `0.42.0`:

- strimzi-cluster-operator-0.42.0.yaml

Overwrite the namespace with `kafka-operator` using (on MacOs) this command:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/namespace: .*/namespace: kafka-operator/' strimzi-cluster-operator-0.42.0.yaml
```

Then, check the differences with the current files:

- cluster-operator.yaml

Check all the updated images and sync/patch them with the https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution-container-image-sync
repository. The patching is done via `kustomization.yaml` and `patch-images.yaml` files.

What was changed:

- STRIMZI_NAMESPACE environment variable set to `*` (to watch all namespaces)
- strimzi-cluster-operator-entity-operator-delegation RoleBinding changed to ClusterRoleBinding (to watch all namespaces)
- strimzi-cluster-operator RoleBinding changed to strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced and ClusterRoleBinding (to watch all namespaces)
- strimzi-cluster-operator-watched RoleBinding changed to ClusterRoleBinding
