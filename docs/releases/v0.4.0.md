## Bug Fixes and Changes 🐛

- Strimzi operator upgraded to `v0.46.0`
- Add support for Kafka versions `3.9.0`, `4.0.0`
- Starting with Kafka version `4.0.0` ZooKeeper has been removed
- Starting with Kafka version `4.0.0` older client protocol API version (pre 2.1.0) and support for Java 11 (broker/tools) has been removed

## Breaking Changes 💔

- Drop support for Kafka versions < `3.9.0`
- ZooKeeper has been removed
- Pre 2.1.0 API version client protocol and Java 11 (broker/tools) have been removed

## Update Guide 🦮

The upgrade procedure consists in two steps:

1. Upgrade the operator.
2. Upgrade the Kafka cluster.

### 1. Upgrade the operator

> [!NOTE]
> The upgrade triggers rolling updates, where brokers are restarted one by one at different stages of the process. During this time, overall cluster availability is temporarily reduced, which may increase the risk of message loss in the event of a broker failure.

Apply the new operator, the new deployment will start with the v0.46.0 running. If there are Kafka clusters of an unsupported version the operator will print an `unsupported version` warning. This will be resolved with the next step.

### 2. Upgrade the Kafka cluster

Edit the Kafka resource of the target cluster and change the version to `4.0.0` or another supported version (`3.9.0`,`4.0.0`). Also change the config section and add the following parameters:

If configured, check that the current `spec.kafka.metadataVersion` is set to a version supported by the version of Kafka you are upgrading to.

For example, the current version is 3.9-IV0 if upgrading from Kafka version 3.9.0 to 4.0.0:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    replicas: 3
    metadataVersion: 3.9-IV0
    version: 3.9.0
    # ...
```

Apply the modified Kafka resource. Wait for the operator to reconcile the cluster. Once done, check that everything is working correctly.

Change the `Kafka.spec.kafka.version` to specify the new Kafka version; leave the `metadataVersion` at the default for the current Kafka version. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    replicas: 3
    metadataVersion: 3.9-IV0
    version: 4.0.0
    # ...
```

Apply the modified Kafka resource. Wait for the operator to reconcile the cluster. Once done, check that everything is working correctly.

If present update KafkaConnect and KafkaMirrorMaker versions.

#### Rolling back the upgrade

In case of errors the upgrade can be rolled back downgrading the operator to the previous version and undoing the changes to the Kafka resource.

#### Finalizing the upgrade

If everything works correctly, the upgrade can be finalized by updating the Kafka resource to use the new `metadataVersion` version, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    replicas: 3
    metadataVersion: 4.0-IV3
    version: 4.0.0
    # ...
```

> [!WARNING]
> Exercise caution when changing the metadataVersion, as downgrading may not be possible. You cannot downgrade Kafka if the metadataVersion for the new Kafka version is higher than the Kafka version you wish to downgrade to.

Wait for the operator to reconcile the cluster and then the upgrade is concluded.

For more information about the upgrade procedure please read Kafka upgrade [documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/40/documentation.html#upgrade). Also useful information can be found on the Strimzi operator [documentation](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/0.45.0/full/deploying#proc-upgrade-kafka-kraft-str).

## Package Strimzi operator! 📦

Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka® cluster on Kubernetes or OpenShift in various deployment configurations.

Our package will be installed as a cluster wide operator, managing clusters on all namespaces.

## Package Monitoring configs! 📦

This package contains the required configurations to monitor the operator and the Kafka clusters using Prometheus and Grafana.
It is based on the [SIGHUP Monitoring][module-monitoring] module.

## Package deployment 🚀

To install all the packages, see the [deployment section](../../README.md#deployment) of the main README.
